# Challenge-2 || Portfolio

## Description

This is the 2nd homework assignment given to us from the bootcamp to make a portfolio from scratch. What was expected is to make a portfolio page that we would work on throughout our time in the bootcamp and hopefully have something near the end that would be presentable and show off all the work we've done throughout the course! It was to practice our CSS skills and using flexbox and other positions we learned in the last week.

## Installation

I made a blank slate using GitBash then inputed it into VSCode and worked in there. Once I got all my images and code setup, I then uploaded it to github. 

## Usage

To access the page, you copy the deployed URL to see the page. With the codes for the HTML and CSS, you just click on the files within the repo to view the lines of code!

## Credits

Thank you MDN for some help on flexbox, also my tutor John for assisting and helping me get a better understanding of flexbox.
